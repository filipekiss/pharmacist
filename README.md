A simple command line to generate PHAR files.

## Usage

``` bash
pharmacist create MySourceDirectory MyPhar.phar
```

### Included files

By default, Pharmacist will package only the files in your `src` and `vendor` folder. This is to prevent useless files to be packaged together making the output file unnecessarily big. This options takes a PCRE as argument. The default is `/(src|vendor)/`. To include all files, for example, you could call

``` bash
pharmacist create MySourceDirectory MyPhar.phar â€”include-files "/.*/"
```

The `CLI entry point` and the `Web Entry Point` will be added separately, so you don't need to worry about them in this option.
